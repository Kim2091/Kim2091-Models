**Description:** The goal of this model is to provide a fast and clean way to anti-alias game footage. This shouldn't be used for games that use TAA or similar, I'm releasing a model later for that.

It can be used with the latest version of MagPie to upscale in real time: <https://github.com/Blinue/Magpie/releases/tag/onnx-preview1>
